# 🔐 Python SHA-256 Brute Force Demonstration

This project is a simple Python script that demonstrates how brute-force attacks can attempt to crack hashed passwords using multithreading. It's designed as an educational tool for beginners to learn about hashing, randomness, and the basics of multithreading.

## 🚀 Features
- Uses **SHA-256 hashing** from Python’s built-in `hashlib` library.
- Multithreaded brute-force attack to speed up the search.
- Random password generation using uppercase letters and digits.
- Tracks time taken to find the correct password.
